# Play-Rock-Paper-Scissor-using-Python-on-Terminal-Against-CPU
Hey, 
This pandemic is hard, we can't just watch Netflix, social media, Prime video etc all day Long.
So, keeping social distancing in mind, here is Rock, Paper, Scissor using Python on a Terminal for all the nerds out there, because I know your sorrow, you don't have a girlfriend to play with(because they all think we are boring)
I will make udated versions by deploying this on Streamlit or a WebPage, and another one by deploying on an App.
Enjoy!
